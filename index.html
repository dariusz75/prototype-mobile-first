				<h3>The Model S is a beast</h3>
				<p>Zero-emission vehicles should no longer be regarded as less capable than their gas-powered peers. While Tesla is so far the only company to introduce a desirable fully electric car with high performance that doesn't make any crucial trade-offs, it just takes one to prove it can be done.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-col">
				<span><i class="fa fa-battery-half" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
				<h3>Tesla sells every car it can make</h3>
				<p>Demand for Tesla's vehicles is growing faster than the company can ramp up supply. Even after delivering the Model S for two years, demand for the car remains mind-boggling.</p>

			<div class="single-col">
				<span><i class="fa fa-battery-quarter" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
				<h3> Tesla has a big vision</h3>
				<p>After add-ons, most buyers spend about $100,000 on a Model S. So while Tesla's only currently available vehicle might be too expensive for many people to even consider buying, the company hopes to change this by late 2016.</p>

				<h3>Tesla runs its business differently</h3>
				<p>Considering the practice unethical, Tesla has vowed to never profit from servicing owner vehicles.
				Tesla doesn't use auto dealers to sell vehicles. Instead, it sells vehicles directly to consumers. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-col">
				<span><i class="fa fa-battery-full" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
				<h3>We are ALL IN</h3>
				<p>This quote comes directly from the company's corporate values statement. It's the last value listed and the only one emphasized with capital letters. The value encapsulates Tesla's focused approach to business.</p>
